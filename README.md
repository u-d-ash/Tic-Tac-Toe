# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic Tic Tac Toe program in C++

## Basic Working
* 2 Players play the game by enter input in (row x column) format [rows and columns are numbered 1 to 3]
* Game ends in either of players winning or a stalemate
* Asks the players if they want to play again and then code re-runs
* Can tackle invalid inputs like 2134 or inputs directing to a cell which are already filled or random strings

## Possible Improvements
* Option of playing with a computer
* Predicting stalemate (as of now, the code will declare stalemate only when all cells are filled)
